Data Schema
===========
- For term definitions, double quotes indicate text copied exactly from the source. In
  the absence of double quotes, paraphrase as accurately as possible.

- Double quotes are not needed for article titles.

- If a term definition spans multiple lines, use the '>-' symbol to indicate how the
  string should be concatenated.

- If a term definition starts with a double quote (because it's a direct quote), also
  use the '>-' symbol to force the string to recognize the double quote as part of the
  string.


Miscellaneous
=============
- At the moment, this CLI does not "search", it uses only exact string lookups.
