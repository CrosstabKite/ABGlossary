  terms:
    rollout: >- 
      A protocol for a staged, test-based launch of a new idea that uses a "holdout"
      group in addition to control and treatment groups. In the first stage, for
      example, the allocation of subjects might be (10% control, 10% treatment, 80%
      holdout). The next stage might be (50% control, 50% treatment, 0% holdout). The
      goal is to avoid the analysis mistake of weighting each observational subject
      equally across all stages, rather than (correctly) doing the analysis for each
      stage separately.

    control:

    split:
    holdout: >-
      a group of subjects (users) who are in the target population for an A/B
      test, but not part of either the control or treatment group.

      website design."
